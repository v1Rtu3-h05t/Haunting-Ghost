üõ°Ô∏è OPERATION SERAPHIM: Digital Exorcism Protocol
Haunting-Ghost is a weaponized Python framework designed for post-infiltration teardown of extremist infrastructure. Built under contract with the Department of War, this tool targets and dismantles digital persistence strategies used by groups like ISIS with surgical precision and spiritual discipline.
This is not a exploitation tool. It is a ritualized cleanse. Deployed only after root access is hacked or exploited.

üéØ Mission Context
Once authorized access is gained to a compromised server, whether through counterterrorism clearance, red-team operations, or forensic investigation, Haunting-Ghost performs a full-spectrum teardown to neutralize adversary control and prevent resurrection. Think of it as locking the bad guys out of their own operation.

üîß What It Does
This framework executes a disciplined sequence of cleansing actions:

Privilege Escalation Removal Strips SUID bits from system shells (/bin/bash, /bin/dash) to revoke unauthorized root access.

Cron Job Purging Deletes scheduled tasks that reapply privilege escalation or spawn reverse shells.

Sudoers File Cleanup Removes injected sudo permissions that grant passwordless root access to stealth users.

Systemd Service Dismantling Disables and deletes malicious services that maintain persistence or autologin as root.

PAM Hook Purging Cleans authentication modules that trigger hidden binaries during login events.

Stealth User Deletion Terminates and removes unauthorized users with elevated privileges.

Reverse Shell Neutralization Kills active reverse shell processes and removes their launch mechanisms.

Legacy Journaling Logs every action with timestamps and opens a Nano journal for final affirmation and operational closure.

üß† Tactical Impact
Live access is severed.

Backdoors are dismantled.

Privilege paths are revoked.

Resurrection mechanisms are destroyed.

The system becomes a dead zone for adversaries.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool is intended solely for authorized use in ethical hacking, red-team operations, and counterterrorism research. Any unauthorized deployment, malicious exploitation, or use against civilian infrastructure is strictly prohibited. Violators may be subject to prosecution under international cybercrime statutes.

Use with honor. Leave no chaos behind.
